# Title

Journey to finding the perfect app architecture.

# Video script

Hello, I am Levi from the Midwest in the United States. I am a freelance native Android & iOS developer building apps for startups. Also being a startup founder and mentor, I put a lot of effort building the highest quality apps for the end user instead of just writing code to get the job done.

When it comes to mobile apps, I think we can all agree apps should be fast, fun, and easy to use. To do this, apps should be built (1) offline first, (2) not ask the same questions twice, (3) when an error occurs, help the user actually resolve the issue (instead of the dreaded, "Error occurred, please try again" message), (4) keep data fresh for the user to get their job done faster. All while (5) keeping the developer experience high by making your apps less prone to bugs.   ..Phew...that sounds like hard work...

Sure, these are the best practices, but as Android devs who have been at this for a while, we know this can be difficult. We tend to care about our deadlines and make shortcuts or excuses to meet them.

Over the past 5 years of my mobile app development, I have been on a continuous journey. A journey to create the perfect app architecture that removes all of these excuses for myself. In this talk, I want to go over the current app architecture that I use for all of my Android & iOS apps (specifically Android) that I have continuously redefined over the past couple dozens apps I have built.

This talk goes over each the best practices I mentioned above with my thought process and code behind each solution.

This intermediate to advanced level talk will cover technical topics such as,
* MVVM using Rx/Realm
* Offline functionality via Android Database and syncing library I wrote
* Data driven UI via "State data" library I wrote (closely resembles Groupon's Grox lib)

I want to deliver a talk that gives developers the "how" to solve each of these best practices to help them to go home and make great apps with no more excuses. We have been building apps for a long time and apps still seem to be built without these best practices?

Thank you so much for your consideration, Levi.
