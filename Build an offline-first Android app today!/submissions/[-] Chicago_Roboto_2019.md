# Abstract 

Offline-first apps give your users offline/spotty network support as well as a faster app experience by removing loading screens. However, they are difficult to create.

3 years ago, I gave myself the challenge to make all of my Android apps I build offline-first. I have learned a great deal since then! 

In this talk, I will:
* Give an overview of how offline-first Android apps are built.
* Provide a list of requirements and edge cases to handle for building offline-first Android apps. 
* Demo of techniques and libraries to build offline-first Android apps.

The goal of this talk is to help intermediate/advanced Android developers take their new or existing apps and add offline support to them. 

Offline-first apps are difficult to create. After this talk, I am confident that you will be able to take on the challenge once and for all!
