# Abstract

(there was a 500 character limit so I edited it a bit)

Offline-first apps give your users offline and spotty network support and a faster app experience by removing loading screens. However, they are difficult to create.

Overview:

* A diagram overview of how offline-first Android apps are built
* A list of requirements for building offline-first Android apps
* Using libraries Wendy and Teller to build offline-first Android apps

The goal of this talk is to help Android developers know where to begin building their own offline-first Android apps.
