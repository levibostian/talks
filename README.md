# Credits

Thanks to Joe and his [hitherejoe/PublicSpeaking](https://github.com/hitherejoe/PublicSpeaking) repo for giving me the inspiration behind this repo. I built this repo in early 2017 but was not sure what to do with it. He gave me the great inspiration behind it with adding a key or files, adding all of my raw submissions, etc.
