# The talks

## 2019

[Loading screens suck!](https://github.com/levibostian/talks/blob/master/Loading%20screens%20suck!/README.md) <--- Newly edited version of the *Build an offline-first Android app today!* talk I submitted in 2018. 

## 2018

[Build an offline-first Android app today!](https://github.com/levibostian/talks/blob/master/Build%20an%20offline-first%20Android%20app%20today!/README.md) <--- This is my current talk I am submitting and hoping to present.

[Journey to finding the perfect app architecture](https://github.com/levibostian/talks/blob/master/%5B-%5D%20Journey%20to%20finding%20the%20perfect%20app%20architecture/README.md) <--- This talk has been cancelled. The topic ended up being too large and I have decided to break it up into many smaller talks.

## 2017

# Credits

Thanks to Joe and his [hitherejoe/PublicSpeaking](https://github.com/hitherejoe/PublicSpeaking) repo for giving me the inspiration behind this repo. I built this repo in early 2017 but was not sure what to do with it. He gave me the great inspiration behind it with adding a key or files, adding all of my raw submissions, etc.
