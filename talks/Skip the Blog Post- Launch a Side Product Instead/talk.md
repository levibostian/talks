### Levi Bostian @levibostian

^ How many of you started a business or work for a business that sells a product.

^ Ok. I'll assume the rest of you do service/consulting based work. Either one I believe will find value in this.

### I ‚ù§Ô∏è building stuff.

### Founder, freelancer, mentor.

![](img/caddy.jpg)

^ I am here talking to you today because I am a founder, freelancer, and mentor.

^ I am the founder of Your Circle, a virtual support group mobile app. I am a freelancer building mobile apps for startups, that's Curiosity IO. I am also the co-founder of Caddy. Tech products for small business owners. We just launched an email product there built just for entrepreneurs like all of you. Check it out, I know you will like it.

^ This is a talk about marketing coming from a guy who you not consider a "marketing expert". This talk is by a guy who builds stuff and works with startups every single day. This is stand-back overview of what I see with many startups and what I do differently.

---

## I am **obsessed** with products.

### Building something that improves the life of someone.

^ For the past year and a half I have dedicated myself to products. Learn how to build products. Learn about the many business models of them. Read and talk to founders who build products. Learn how to sell products. I have become obsessed with everything having to do with building products.

^ You are the lucky ones. You get to hear about all of my knowledge I have built up over the past couple of years. Meeting and talking to founders and their experiences.

---

"How do I build an audience for my new product?", you ask.

"Easy! Create a Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat account. Create a blog. Buy Facebook ads."

Done.

^ Congrats! You started a new business! Now, you ask...

---

Typical marketing plan I see:

* Social media accounts.
* Blog posts.
* Ads online.

^ Though my experience with startups, this is the typical content marketing plan they have to build an audience. Create tons of noise to gain the eyeballs of people in the market.

---

### "We can't hire a sales team."

### "It's what everyone else is doing."

### "It's easy."

^ When I ask the founders why they choose this plan, these are the responses that I get...

^ These don't see like convincing reasons to me.

---

### **What is marketing again?**

Find new group of people. Build a relationship. Gain trust. Show them how you can improve their life.

Why measure in eyeballs? Instead, measure by happy/engaged people.

^ I see so many startups doing what is easy, doing what is hot. Doing all they can for pure eyeballs and attention.

^ Take a step back and remind yourself what marketing really is...

---

Compared to core product, blog posts not super engaging.

People come once, maybe read post, and never come back.

^ (read slide)

---

Compared to core product, blog posts do not gain very much trust.

![right](img/gain_trust_chart.jpeg)

^ (read slide)

---

But for time and cost, blog posts can be cost efficient compared to building a core product.

![right](img/cost_chart.jpeg)

^ (read slide)

---

### **My question:**

## Is there a better way?

High engagement. Builds relationships. Gains trust. Cost effective.

...Not blocked by adblock üòâ

**Does this exist?!?!**

^ (read slide)

---

## Yes.

^ Yes. Of course the answer is yes or why would I be talking to you today?

---

### Side project marketing.

#### Build side projects that drive sales to core product of business.

###### High engagement. Low cost. Builds trust.

^ Ta-da!! Side project marketing...

---

### **Fact:**

### People **hire products** to solve problems in their lives.

^ I did not quote this. I heard it in a tweet or something. (read it)

---

* Apps on your phone.
* Clothes you are wearing.
* The book you're reading.
* The notebook you're writing on.
* Me! This conference.

^ Think about it. (read slide).

^ All of these things you have hired to make your life better. Products are awesome!

---

## **Q:** Who is doing this already?

^ I did not invent this idea of side project marketing. I simply subscribe to it because I believe in it's opportunity.

Cool.

## Now, how do I come up with ideas?

^ Cool. You know why to build. How do you do it?

---

Be your customer. **Get in their head.**

What problems do they have?

^ To think of ideas, you need to get in your customer's head. If you do not know your customer all that well, you may not find as much success here yet.

^ Every problem they have from wake up to going to bed.

---

**Think to yourself,**

1. Do I have knowledge to share?
2. Can I re-use what already built?
3. Can I build an audience?
4. Do you have problems internally?

^ These are 4 methods that I use to think of ideas. (read it)

---

**Do I have knowledge to share?**

* eBooks
* Video courses
* Webinars

Jason Fried - Rework, Way To Work events.
Justin Jackson - Learns something, makes course.

^ I can guarantee that all of you have knowledge that someone else would find valuable. Guarantee it. Share it.

^ (read it)

---

**Can I re-use what already built?**

* Sell small pieces of main product
* License product

NomadList - Escape the Trump, Escape the Brexit.
Your Circle - Adoption, high schoolers.

^ In your main core product, you are solving tons of mini problems.

^ Can you license out your technology stack?

^ Do others find what you have built useful?

---

**Can I build an audience?**

* Forum online community
* Newsletter
* Podcast

Justin Jackson - Community, podcast, 100 Maker challenge.
Jason Fried - Community want to work like Basecamp.

^ Is there a way to build an audience with what you are doing?

^ 100 maker challenge...

---

**Do you have problems internally?**

* Team issues
* Blog about team
* Scratch your own itches

Crew - Unsplash
37 signals - Basecamp, Highrise, etc.

^ Crew builds websites. Needed to find better quality stock photography...

^ 37 signals, a design consulting company had problems managing team. Built basecamp...

---

I have an idea. How do I build it?

* Tumblr, Squarespace (site).
* Mailchimp, Revue (newsletter).
* Gumroad (store).
* Teachable, Coach (teach course).
* Medium, Ghost (blog).

^ We are so lucky today...

^ I challenge you to build without code and design...

^ There are many more ways...

---

1. Build side project (start with just a landing page).

2. Maintain if you see it working.

3. Repeat.

Experiment. Have fun. Don't sweat it.

^ Your side projects are going to fail and they will succeed. Build then, maintain if doing well, repeat.

^ Don't sweat it. Learn something and it will grow an audience along the way if it fails anyway.

---

### **Q:** Do blogs and ads suck? Should I stop doing them?

^ No. In fact, blogs are products themselves...

---

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more likely you‚Äôll use a good product many times than read a good blog post many times. With a blog, you need to continually produce content at a high level and high rate to keep people coming back. This is possible, it just takes longer‚Äù
### -- Crew‚Äôs founder Mikael.

^ (read it)

---

### **Q:** Once I create all of these products, do I need to maintain them all?

^ No. Ask yourself this (next slide)

---

### ‚ÄúWill improving this existing project be more valuable than building a new one?‚Äù

1. Unsplash.com
2. App vs Website
3. Blog
4. Moodboard
5. Build an online business
6. ~~Launch this year~~

^ Crew only maintains it's top 5 referral source to Crew.co. In fact, I know of 2 I used to use and they are no longer on their website.

---

# [fit] Basecamp.com

![](img/basecamp_home.png)

#### (started as internal project)

^ Basecamp started as a side project internally and turned into a business on it's own as well.

---

### **Q:** What do I charge for these side products I create?

^ Up to you. Most give away for free. However, build in a way they would pay.

---

### **Q:** Where am I in this journey?

![left](img/your_circle_journey.jpg)
![right](img/caddy_journey.jpg)

^ It's a journey alright. I am not as far along as any of the companies in this talk.
