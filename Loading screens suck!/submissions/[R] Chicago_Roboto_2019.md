# Abstract 

Making your app offline-first allows your users to complete tasks faster no matter how spotty their network connection may be. The problem is, building offline-first apps is hard. How do you perform background syncs? What do you show in the UI for old cached data? 

I have made it my mission to make offline-first my default way to build apps. 3 years and a dozen apps later, I want to share with you how to build an offline-first app. I want to show you that making offline-first apps is so easy, it's stupid not to.
