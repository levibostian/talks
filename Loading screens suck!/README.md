# Loading screens suck!

This is the same talk, different abstract for *Build an offline-first Android app today! After some feedback from [a friend of mine](https://kingfisherdata.com/about-us/), Ed Leighton-Dick, who speaks reguarly at tech conferences, I made some changes:

1. The abstract needs to be written for the person attending the conference trying to decide what talks to attend. It's not an overview for the selection team of the conference (what I previously thought an abstract was for). 
2. What is the reason someone wants to attend your talk? Define the problem clearly and head on. 
3. Keep it simple. Talk in plain English. Again, write it for the reader attending the conference!

Thank you to [Joe Birch](https://github.com/hitherejoe/PublicSpeaking) for open sourcing his talks, I was able to read examples of good tech conference abstracts to help me write mine. Finding good examples of abstracts is much harder then I thought so again, thank you Joe.

# Abstract

Making your app offline-first allows your users to complete tasks faster no matter how spotty their network connection may be. The problem is, building offline-first apps is hard. How do you perform background syncs? What do you show in the UI for old cached data? 

I have made it my mission to make offline-first my default way to build apps. 3 years and a dozen apps later, I want to share with you how to build an offline-first app. I want to show you that making offline-first apps is so easy, it's stupid not to.
