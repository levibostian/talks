# Skip the Blog Post - Launch a Side Product Instead

Talk I did for EntreFEST May 4th, 2017.

# What is it about?

Build side projects that drive sales to your core product of your business. The typical marketing plan for a startup is all about creating a ton of content on social media that generates noise to gain eyeballs. I am introducing this other form of marketing that I see being much more valuable. Building side projects that gain trust and builds relationships with the market that drive sales decisions much better.

# Recording?

# Resources for the talk

[SideProject.life](http://sideproject.life/) - A side project I built for this talk on side projects, haha! Everything from the talk and more (I built this site in a couple hours using Tumblr by the way). (there is a copy of this site in this directory. Check out the `SideProject.life website` folder.)

# Building

Talk speaker deck built with Deckset. Highly recommend it. `talk.md` along with all the `img/` images are what makes up the deck.
